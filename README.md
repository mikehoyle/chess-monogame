# Chess

A super-simple chess implementation written to learn the [Monogame](https://www.monogame.net/) framework.

Is mostly playable outside of missing a few core features:
- Piece promotion
- Recognizing check & restricting moves that put/keep your own king in check
- Recognizing checkmate.

TL;DR probably best to use Lichess :P
